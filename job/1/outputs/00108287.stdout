  ------- MODEL REPORT ------
  The un-condensed model contains:
      93 variables comprising 3860 thousand components
  and 67 equation blocks comprising 3027 thousand separate equations.
  
      10 variables (comprising 1513 thousand components) will be backsolved for.
      10 variables (comprising 1437 thousand components) were substituted out.
      8 variables (comprising 681 thousand components) were omitted.
  
  So the condensed model contains:
      65 variables comprising 228 thousand components
  and 47 equation blocks comprising 76 thousand separate equations.

   available levels solutions you wish to see.
  
  You can select these options directly from the main SLTOHT
   options menu (even though they are not shown on it).
  
    Option      Meaning
     LVB       Just report the BEFORE (ie pre-simulation) levels
     LVA       Just report the AFTER (ie post-simulation) levels
     LVC       Just report the CHANGES in levels values
     NLV       Report NO levels values [This is the default.]
   [Option LV4 (separate output) no longer here - use SHL+SEP instead]
